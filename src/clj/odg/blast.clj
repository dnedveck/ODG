  Identifies blast hits that would be considered a BEST_BLAST_MATCH out of context. Meaning the match

  These are the rules for generating a BLAST_BEST_MATCH out of context:

  * Percent ID > 99% and alignment length is at least 80% of query or 80% of subject
  * Percent ID > 99.9% and alignment length is at least 50% of query of subject length

  #TODO: In the future it would be nice to take the result of this filtered list, and eliminate
  BEST_BLAST_MATCH's down to 1 or a few (if all other matching variables are the same).
  We often find alt. transcripts map to each other regularly, creating invalid matches.
  This is currently handled at the application level logic, and hopefully, properly, in our DSL.
